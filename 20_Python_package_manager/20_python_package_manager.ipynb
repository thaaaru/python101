    "### What is PIP ?\n",
    "\n",
    "PIP stands for Preferred installer program. We use _pip_ to install different Python packages.\n",
    "Package is a Python module that can contain one or more modules or other packages. A module or modules that we can install to our application is a package.\n",
    "In programming, we do not have to write every utility program, instead we install packages and import them to our applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing PIP\n",
    "\n",
    "If you did not install pip, let us install it now. Go to your terminal or command prompt and copy and paste this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "Tharaka@Tharaka:~$ pip install pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Check if pip is installed by writing\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",

    "pip 21.1.3 from /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.9.6)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, I am using pip version 21.1.3, if you see some number a bit below or above that, means you have pip installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us check some of the packages used in the Python community for different purposes. Just to let you know that there are lots of packages available for use with different applications.\n",
    "\n",
