    "\n",
    "In Python we have lots of built-in functions. Built-in functions are globally available for your use that mean you can make use of the built-in functions without importing or configuring. Some of the most commonly used Python built-in functions are the following: _print()_, _len()_, _type()_, _int()_, _float()_, _str()_, _input()_, _list()_, _dict()_, _min()_, _max()_, _sum()_, _sorted()_, _open()_, _file()_, _help()_, and _dir()_. In the following table you will see an exhaustive list of Python built-in functions taken from [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/functions.html).\n",

    "As you can see from the terminal above, Python has got reserved words. We do not use reserved words to declare variables or functions. We will cover variables in the next section.\n",

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables store data in a computer memory. Mnemonic variables are recommended to use in many programming languages. A mnemonic variable is a variable name that can be easily remembered and associated. A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored.\n",
    "Number at the beginning, special character, hyphen are not allowed when naming a variable. A variable can have a short name (like x, y, z), but a more descriptive name (firstname, lastname, age, country) is highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Variable Name Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\n",
    "- A variable name cannot start with a number\n",
    "- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and \\_ )\n",
    "- Variable names are case-sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FirstName and FIRSTNAME) are different variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some example of valid variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "firstname\n",
    "lastname\n",
    "age\n",
    "country\n",
    "city\n",
    "first_name\n",
    "last_name\n",
    "capital_city\n",
    "_if # if we want to use reserved word as a variable\n",
    "year_2021\n",
    "year2021\n",
    "current_year_2021\n",
    "birth_year\n",
    "num1\n",
    "num2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Invalid variables names\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "first-name\n",

    "first$name\n",
    "num-1\n",
    "1num\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use standard Python variable naming style which has been adopted by many Python developers. Python developers use snake case(snake_case) variable naming convention. We use underscore character after each word for a variable containing more than one word(eg. first_name, last_name, engine_rotation_speed).  The example below is an example of standard naming of variables, underscore is required when the variable name is more than one word.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we assign a certain data type to a variable, it is called variable declaration. For instance in the example below my first name is assigned to a variable first_name. The equal sign is an assignment operator. Assigning means storing data in the variable. The equal sign in Python is not equality as in Mathematics.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let us use the _print()_ and _len()_ built-in functions. Print function takes unlimited number of arguments. An argument is a value which we can be passed or put inside the function parenthesis, see the example below.\n",

    "\n",
    "```py\n",

    "There are several data types in Python. To identify the data type we use the _type_ built-in function. I would like to ask you to focus on understanding different data types very well. When it comes to programming, it is all about data types. I introduced data types at the very beginning and it comes again, because every topic is related to data types. We will cover data types in more detail in their respective sections.\n",
