    "### Assignment Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Let us take = as an example. Equal sign in mathematics shows that two values are equal, however in Python it means we are storing a value in a certain variable and we call it assignment or a assigning value to a variable. The table below shows the different types of python assignment operators, taken from [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp).\n",
