    "## Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression or RegEx is a special text string that helps to find patterns in data. A RegEx can be used to check if some pattern exists in a different data type. To use RegEx in python first we should import the RegEx module which is called *re*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The *re* Module\n",
    "\n",
    "After importing the module we can use it to detect or find patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import re\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods in *re* Module\n",
    "\n",
    "To find a pattern we use different set of *re* character sets that allows to search for a match in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *re.match()*: searches only in the beginning of the first line of the string and returns matched objects if  found, else returns None.\n",
    "- *re.search*: Returns a match object if there is one anywhere in the string, including multiline strings.\n",
    "- *re.findall*: Returns a list containing all matches\n",
    "- *re.split*: Takes a string, splits it at the match points, returns a list\n",
    "- *re.sub*:  Replaces one or many matches within a string\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Match\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# syntac\n",
    "re.match(substring, string, re.I)\n",
    "# substring is a string or a pattern, string is the text we look for a pattern , re.I is case ignore\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "txt = 'I love to teach python and javaScript'\n",
    "# It returns an object with span, and match\n",
    "match = re.match('I love to teach', txt, re.I)\n",
    "print(match)  # <re.Match object; span=(0, 15), match='I love to teach'>\n",
    "# We can get the starting and ending position of the match as tuple using span\n",
    "span = match.span()\n",
    "print(span)     # (0, 15)\n",
    "# Lets find the start and stop position from the span\n",
    "start, end = span\n",
    "print(start, end)  # 0, 15\n",
    "substring = txt[start:end]\n",
    "print(substring)       # I love to teach\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the example above, the pattern we are looking for (or the substring we are looking for) is *I love to teach*. The match function returns an object **only** if the text starts with the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "txt = 'I love to teach python and javaScript'\n",
    "match = re.match('I like to teach', txt, re.I)\n",
    "print(match)  # None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The string does not string with *I like to teach*, therefore there was no match and the match method returned None.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Search\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# syntax\n",
    "re.match(substring, string, re.I)\n",
    "# substring is a pattern, string is the text we look for a pattern , re.I is case ignore flag\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "# It returns an object with span and match\n",
    "match = re.search('first', txt, re.I)\n",

    "substring = txt[start:end]\n",
    "print(substring)       # first\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, search is much better than match because it can look for the pattern throughout the text. Search returns a match object with a first match that was found, otherwise it returns *None*. A much better *re* function is *findall*. This function checks for the pattern through the whole string and returns all the matches as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Searching for All Matches Using *findall*\n",
    "\n",
