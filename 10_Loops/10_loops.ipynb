    "## Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Life is full of routines. In programming we also do lots of repetitive tasks. In order to handle repetitive task programming languages use loops. Python programming language also provides the following types of two loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. while loop\n",
    "2. for loop\n",
    "\n",
    "### While Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the reserved word _while_ to make a while loop. It is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. When the condition becomes false, the lines of code after the loop will be continued to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "  # syntax\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    code goes here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count = count + 1\n",
    "#prints from 0 to 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above while loop, the condition becomes false when count is 5. That is when the loop stops.\n",
    "If we are interested to run block of code once the condition is no longer true, we can use _else_.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "  # syntax\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    code goes here\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    code goes here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count = count + 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above loop condition will be false when count is 5 and the loop stops, and execution starts the else statement. As a result 5 will be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Break and Continue - Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- Break: We use break when we like to get out of or stop the loop.\n",
    "\n",

    "    if count == 3:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above while loop only prints 0, 1, 2, but when it reaches 3 it stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continue: With the continue statement we can skip the current iteration, and continue with the next:\n",

    "The above while loop only prints 0, 1, 2 and 4 (skips 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A _for_ keyword is used to make a for loop, similar with other programming languages, but with some syntax differences. Loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).\n",

    "### The Range Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The _range()_ function is used list of numbers. The _range(start, end, step)_ takes three parameters: starting, ending and increment. By default it starts from 0 and the increment is 1. The range sequence needs at least 1 argument (end).\n",
